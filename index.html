				<p class="text one">Ferdinand Magellan, Portuguese Fernão de Magalhães, Spanish Fernando de Magallanes
					or
					Hernando
					de Magallanes, (born 1480, Sabrosa or Porto?, Portugal—died April 27, 1521, Mactan, Philippines),
					Portuguese
					navigator and explorer who sailed under the flags of both Portugal (1505–13) and Spain (1519–21).
					From
					Spain
					he sailed around South America, discovering the Strait of Magellan, and across the Pacific. Though
					he
					was
					killed in the Philippines, one of his ships continued westward to Spain, accomplishing the first
					circumnavigation of Earth. The voyage was successfully terminated by the Basque navigator Juan
					Sebastián
					del
					Cano.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="block">
				<h2 class="subtitle">Early life</h2>
				<p class="text two">Magellan was the son of Rui de Magalhães and Alda de Mesquita, members of the
					Portuguese
					nobility. At an early age he became a page to Queen Leonor, wife of John II (reigned 1481–95) and
					sister of Manuel I (reigned 1495–1521), in Lisbon. In early 1505 he enlisted in the fleet of
					Francisco de Almeida, first viceroy of Portuguese India, whose expedition King Manuel sent to check
					Muslim sea power along the African and Indian coasts and to establish a strong Portuguese presence
					in the Indian Ocean. During a naval engagement at Cannanore (now Kannur) on the Malabar Coast of
					India, Magellan is said by the chronicler Gaspar Correia (also spelled Corrêa) to have been wounded.
					Though Correia states that during this early period of his Indian service, Magellan acquired
					considerable knowledge of navigation, little is known of Magellan’s first years in the East until he
					appears among those sailing in November 1506 with Nuno Vaz Pereira to Sofala on the Mozambique
					coast, where the Portuguese had established a fort.</p>
				<p class="text three">By 1507 Magellan was back in India. He took part, on February 2–3, 1509, in the
					great
					Battle of Diu, in which the Portuguese defeated a Muslim fleet and thereby gained supremacy over
					most of the Indian Ocean. Reaching Cochin (now Kochi, India) in the fleet of Diogo Lopes de
					Sequeira, he subsequently left for the Malay city-state of Malacca (now Melaka, Malaysia). Magellan
					is mentioned as being sent to warn the commander of the Portuguese ships in Malacca’s waters of
					impending attack by Malays. During the subsequent fighting he saved the life of a Portuguese
					explorer, his close friend Francisco Serrão. (Serrão, possibly a relative of Magellan’s, had sailed
					with Magellan to India in 1505.) Magellan attempted to return to Portugal afterward but was
					unsuccessful. At a council held at Cochin on October 10, 1510, to decide on plans for retaking
					Goa—which the Portuguese had captured earlier in the year but then lost—he advised against taking
					large ships at that season. Nevertheless, the new Portuguese governor in India, Afonso de
					Albuquerque, did so, and the city fell to the Portuguese on November 24. Magellan’s name does not
					appear among those who fought.</p>
				<p class="text four">The Portuguese victories off the eastern coast of Africa and the western coast of
					India
					had broken Muslim power in the Indian Ocean, and the purpose of Almeida’s expedition—to wrest from
					the Arabs the key points of sea trade—was almost accomplished. Yet without control of Malacca, their
					achievement was incomplete. At the end of June 1511, therefore, a fleet under Albuquerque left for
					Malacca, which fell after six weeks. This event, in which Magellan took part, was the crowning
					Portuguese victory in the Orient. Through Malacca passed the wealth of the East to the harbours of
					the West, and in command of the Malacca Strait the Portuguese held the key to the seas and ports of
					Malaysia. It remained only to explore the wealth-giving Moluccas (now part of Indonesia), the
					islands of spice. Accordingly, early in December 1511 they sailed on a voyage of reconnaissance, and
					after reaching Banda they returned with spice in 1512. The claim made by some that Magellan went on
					this voyage rests on unproven statements by Italian geographer Giovanni Battista Ramusio and Spanish
					historian Leonardo de Argensola, and the want of evidence argues against its acceptance. However, it
					is known that Magellan’s friend Serrão was in command of one of the ships and that he later sent
					Magellan helpful information from the Moluccas about those islands.</p>
				<p class="text five">By mid-1513 Magellan was back in Lisbon, but he soon joined the forces sent against
					the
					Moroccan stronghold of Azamor (Azemmour). In a skirmish that August he sustained a leg wound that
					caused him to limp for the rest of his life. Returning to Lisbon in November 1514, he asked King
					Manuel for a token increase in his pension as a reward. But unfounded reports of irregular conduct
					on his part had reached the king: after the siege of Azamor, Magellan was accused of having sold a
					portion of the war spoils back to the enemy. Refusing Magellan’s request for a reward, Manuel
					ordered him back to Morocco. Early in 1516 Magellan renewed his petition; the king, refusing once
					more, told him he might offer his services elsewhere.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="block">
				<h2 class="subtitle">Allegiance to Spain of Ferdinand Magellan</h2>
				<p class="text six">Magellan therefore went to Spain, reaching Sevilla (Seville) on October 20, 1517. He
					was
					joined in December by the Portuguese cosmographer Rui Faleiro and possibly by Rui’s brother
					Francisco Faleiro. Magellan and Rui Faleiro journeyed to the court at Valladolid, where they offered
					their services to King Charles I (later, Holy Roman emperor Charles V). Magellan, until this point
					bearing the Portuguese name Fernão de Magalhães, henceforward became known by the Spanish version of
					his name—Fernando de Magallanes.</p>
				<p class="text seven">By the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494), all newly discovered and undiscovered
					territories
					east of a line of demarcation (370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands) were assigned to
					Portugal; all that lay west belonged to Spain. Magellan and Faleiro now proposed to sail west to
					give practical proof of their claim that the Spice Islands lay west of the line of demarcation—that
					is, within the Spanish, not the Portuguese, hemisphere. Magellan was convinced that he would lead
					his ships from the Atlantic to the “Sea of the South” by discovering a strait through Tierra Firme
					(the South American mainland). This idea did not originate with him; others had sought a passage by
					which vessels sailing continuously westward would reach the East and thus avoid the African Cape of
					Good Hope, which was controlled by the Portuguese.</p>

					<p class="description">Map showing the line of demarcation between Spanish and Portuguese territory,
						as first defined by Pope Alexander VI (1493) and later revised by the Treaty of Tordesillas
						(1494). Spain won control of lands discovered west of the line, while Portugal gained rights to
						new lands to the east.</p>
				</div>
				<p class="text eight">On March 22, 1518, their proposal received royal assent. Magellan and Faleiro were
					appointed joint captains general of an expedition directed to seek an all-Spanish route to the
					Moluccas. In the royal agreement, Magellan and Faleiro were directed to find “the” strait, referring
					to the hypothetical passage through Tierra Firme. The government of any lands discovered was to be
					vested in them and their heirs, and they were to receive a one-twentieth share of the net profits
					from the venture. Both also were invested with the Order of Santiago, a Spanish military-religious
					knighthood.</p>
				<p class="text nine">The Spanish seafaring community reacted strongly against the king’s acceptance of
					the
					Portuguese-led expedition. The influence of Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca, the bishop of Burgos and head
					of the powerful Casa de Contratación (House of Commerce), an administrative entity that oversaw all
					Spanish explorations, hindered the proper organization of the expedition, which was delayed more
					than once. Agents of the Portuguese crown, outraged by Magellan’s transfer of allegiance, also made
					an unsuccessful attempt to wreck the project. Ultimately, the number of Portuguese sailors assigned
					to the expedition was strictly limited, Fonseca managed to install a Spanish officer as a sort of
					cocommander of the fleet, and Magellan lost his Portuguese cocaptain, Faleiro, whose mental
					instability prevented him from sailing. Conflicts between the Portuguese and Spanish officers on
					board would lead to severe discipline problems.</p>
				<p class="text ten">Spanish officials furnished five ships for the expedition, prepared in Sevilla.
					Magellan’s flagship, the Trinidad, had as consorts the San Antonio, the Concepción, the Victoria,
					and the Santiago. The ships were old ones, not in the best condition or fitted as Magellan would
					have liked. Nevertheless, Magellan—who in 1517 had married Beatriz Barbosa, daughter of an important
					official in Sevilla—said farewell to his wife and infant son, Rodrigo, before his ships left
					Sanlúcar de Barrameda on September 20, 1519.</p>

				<h2 class="subtitle">Discovery of the Strait of Magellan</h2>
				<p class="text eleven">The fleet, carrying about 270 men, predominantly from Spain and Portugal but also
					from
					far-flung parts of Europe and North Africa, reached Tenerife in the Canary Islands on September 26,
					1519, and set sail on October 3 for Brazil. Becalmed off the Guinea coast of Africa, it met storms
					before reaching the Equator; by November 29, having crossed the Atlantic successfully, it was 27
					leagues southwest of Cape St. Augustine (Cabo de Santo Agostinho, Brazil). Rounding Cape Frio,
					Magellan entered the bay of Rio de Janeiro on December 13. He then sailed south to the Río de la
					Plata and vainly probed the estuary, seeking the strait. On March 31, 1520, he reached Port Saint
					Julian (San Julián, Argentina), where on Easter day at midnight Spanish captains led a serious
					mutiny against the Portuguese commander. With resolution, ruthlessness, and daring, Magellan quelled
					it: he executed one of the mutinous captains and left another to his fate ashore when, on August 24,
					1520, the fleet left Saint Julian.</p>
				<p class="text twelve">After reaching the mouth of the Santa Cruz River, near which the Santiago,
					surveying the
					area, had been wrecked earlier, Magellan started south again. On October 21, 1520, he rounded the
					Cape of the Virgins (Cabo Vírgenes, Argentina) and at approximately 52°50′ S entered the passage
					that proved to be the strait of his seeking, later to bear his name. The San Antonio having
					deserted, only three of his ships reached the western end of the passage. At the news that the ocean
					had been sighted, the iron-willed admiral reportedly broke down and cried with joy.</p>
				<p class="text thirteen">On November 28, 1520, the Trinidad, the Concepción, and the Victoria entered
					the “Sea of
					the South,” from their calm crossing later called the Pacific Ocean. Tortured by thirst, stricken by
					scurvy, feeding on rat-fouled biscuits, and finally reduced to eating the leather off the yardarms,
					the crews, driven first by the Peru Current and throughout the voyage by the relentless
					determination of Magellan, made the great crossing of the Pacific. Until December 18 they had sailed
					near the Chilean coast; then Magellan took a course northwestward. Not until January 24, 1521, was
					land sighted, probably Pukapuka Atoll in the Tuamotu Archipelago (now part of French Polynesia).
					Crossing the equinoctial line at approximately 158° W on February 13, the voyagers on March 6 made
					first landfall at Guam in the Mariana Islands, where they obtained fresh food for the first time in
					99 days.</p>

				</div>
				<p class="text fourteen">A statement sent to King Charles by Magellan before he left Spain suggests that
					he knew
					(probably partly from Serrão’s letters or perhaps from his own possible voyage there in 1511–12) the
					approximate position of the Moluccas. In sailing from the Marianas to the islands later called the
					Philippines, instead of heading directly to the Spice Islands, he was doubtless dominated by the
					idea of gathering provisions and the advantage of securing a base before visiting the Moluccas.
					Thus, leaving the Marianas on March 9, 1521, Magellan steered west-southwestward to the Philippines,
					where, in late March and early April, he secured the first alliance in the Pacific for Spain (at
					Limasawa Island) and the conversion to Christianity of the ruler of Cebu Island and his chief men.
					Weeks later, however, Magellan was killed in a fight with the people of nearby Mactan Island.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="block">
				<h2 class="subtitle">Circumnavigation of the globe of Ferdinand Magellan</h2>
				<p class="text fifteen">After Magellan’s death only two of the ships, the Trinidad and the Victoria,
					reached the
					Moluccas. Gonzalo Gómez de Espinosa, Magellan’s master-at-arms, attempted to return to Spain on the
					Trinidad, but it soon became evident that the ship was no longer seaworthy. Espinosa himself then
					was arrested by Portuguese officials and imprisoned. Cano, originally master of the Concepción and a
					participant in the mutiny at Port Saint Julian, took the chance of continuing westward with the
					Victoria, as he likely determined that the crew would not survive another extremely hard voyage
					across the Pacific. On his way across the Indian Ocean and up the western coast of Africa, he had
					the chance not to be intercepted by the Portuguese ships that regularly traveled the route. For
					taking home to Spain, on September 8, 1522, the leaking but spice-laden Victoria, with only 17 other
					European survivors and a small number of Moluccans, “weaker than men have ever been before,” Cano
					received from Emperor Charles an augmentation to his coat of arms—a globe with the inscription
					“Primus circumdedisti me” (“You were the first to encircle me”).</p>
			</div>
			<div class="block">
				<h2 class="subtitle">Legacy</h2>
				<p class="text sixteen">Magellan was undoubtedly one of the most skilled sailors of the great age of
					European
					maritime discoveries. Yet because he sailed in the service of the king of Spain, Portuguese
					historians have tended not to grant him the credit given to other eminent Portuguese navigators,
					such as Bartolomeu Dias and Vasco da Gama. Spanish historians, on the other hand, have preferred to
					emphasize the role of the Spanish (actually Basque) navigator Cano. However, Magellan did only what
					his predecessors Christopher Columbus, John Cabot, and Amerigo Vespucci had done: lacking the
					opportunity to pursue their goals under the sponsorship of their own country, they looked for
					support elsewhere. This was a common attitude in the 15th and 16th centuries, a time before the age
					of nationalism and a time when men pledged allegiance not to the place where they were born but to a
					king. The early explorers served the monarch who supported their goals of fortune and fame, and the
					monarch in turn accepted the fealty of men who would enhance the wealth and power of the crown.</p>

				</div>
				<p class="text seventeen">Notwithstanding the neglect of Iberian historians, Magellan’s complex
					character, his
					uncommonly eventful life, and the extreme difficulty of the voyage itself have fueled imaginations
					ever since the first account of the expedition—recorded by one of its few survivors, Antonio
					Pigafetta—appeared in the 16th century. Later biographers, such as the 20th-century writer Stefan
					Zweig, have portrayed Magellan as a symbol of the human capacity to succeed against all odds. Other
					contemporary authors have attempted to illustrate the magnitude of his accomplishment by likening
					his voyage through unknown waters to the first explorations of space.</p>
				<p class="text eighteen">Such a comparison might even be said to underestimate Magellan’s feat—a
					16th-century
					maritime expedition was arguably much more unpredictable, and hence far more perilous, than
					computer-assisted space travel—but in any case, the achievements of Magellan were of profound
					importance. His supreme accomplishment was the discovery and crossing of the South American strait
					that bears his name—a major navigational task, considering the knowledge of the period. Moreover,
					being the first to traverse the “Sea of the South” from east to west, he demonstrated the immensity
					of the Pacific Ocean and the challenges it posed to navigation. Finally, the idea of the voyage
					itself had relied on the not-undisputed idea of a spherical Earth. The circumnavigation completed by
					Magellan’s expedition thus confirmed the conception of the world as a globe.</p>
